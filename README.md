A beginner attempt to create an Ensemble Machine Learning model to predict Walmart weekly sales

Hello, I have been learning Python and thought of starting my first project which is to forecast Walmart weekly sales using Ensemble Machine Learning model. Thanks to M Yasser H for the Kaggle dataset. You may obtain the dataset from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/walmart-dataset

Thanks to Eric Kleppen for the comprehensive guide on determining outliers. You may read his article/guide here: https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/data-analytics/how-to-find-outliers/ for the guide
